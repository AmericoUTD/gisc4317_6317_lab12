Nasdaq Composite Generator

Description:
The purpose of my project is intended for anybody wanting to know the Nasdaq Composite in real-time by a click of a button.
The integrated development environment (IDE) used is Spyder for Python, and PyQt5 is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI).
When running the code through Spyder, a window will appear that will display two boxes that say “Press” and “Nasdaq Composite.”
The box labeled “Press” is a button for a user to click, and once clicked, the Nasdaq Composite will appear on the box below.
The Nasdaq Composite is obtained by web scraping a Google search result of the Nasdaq Composite.
