My plan for the final project is to create a program that allows the user to quickly input play-by-play data for basketball games while watching the game. I know basketball data is available in box scores and via basketballreference.com, but I have tried to do some analysis with basketball data in the past and have had trouble downloading in the format that I want and getting what data I need. For this class, it will be just a simple program that allows the user to quickly input who shot the basket, whether they made or missed, and what type of shot it was (3 point fga, 2 point fga, free throw). It could be expanded on to input data for other stats such as rebounds, assists, and turnovers in the future, but that is hard to implement in a way where one user can keep up in real time with the game. I plan to do Lab X so that I can learn how to implement a graphical interface, because that will make data input way more intuitive and fast. Data will upload into a dataframe of shot by shot data, which I can then use to aggregate and summarized play level data. I will try to use this program to log data for a basketball game in real time, and see how it performs. Let me know what you guys thing, I might be going to big at the moment but I am going to try and play it by ear and scale it down if I need to as I go.
