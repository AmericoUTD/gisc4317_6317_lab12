While using webscraping is popular for resarch analytics and many pre-built tools exist I would like to take it a step further and add geographic context to it. So I will use/build a webscraper to get papers based on a given search parameter (or set of parameters) from a repository such as Scopus. Those papers are then scraped for the geographic locations of the parameter (eg. Forest fires) and then they are then mapped. I expect to find location data as coordinates in some papers and place names in others so my application will have to map the locations of the keyword research with this in mind. The idea is to give the user at a glance information on the spatial distribution of the body of research they are undertaking. Time permitting a user interface that allows for interactive outputs will also be created.
